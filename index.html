        <h2 id='sauce'>The Sauce </h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">Spicy, tasty, necessary, red. These are some of the descriptors of the now famous
            condiment. Once you could
            probably only find this item gracing the table of your favorite Pho restaurant; now it's creator says that
            it won't advertise because it already cannot keep up with demand. There are now countless recipes that exist
            that call for it. Fast food restaurants use it as a burger topping. It is now becoming ubiquitous in
            American dining. And it's thanks to Vietnamese refugee David Tran.
        </p>

        <h2 id='founder'>The Founder</h2>

        <p>While there are debates about who created the original srirach sauce, it was David Tran who made it
            famous in the United States. Born in Soc Trang, Vietnam, David made his own version of the chili sauce,
            Pepper Sa-te, which would become the famous condiment we know today. In 1979, David and thousands of
            other refugees boarded the freighter Huey Fong, en route to America. What first started as a product he
            made at home and sold in recycled glass baby food jars, now requires a 45,000 square meter warehouse and
            14,000 square meter production facility.

        <h2 id='ingredients'>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>The sauce itself is composed of only a few simple ingredients. That bright, red color comes from the fresh
            jalapenos which are grown, harvested, and sold specifically to Huy Fong. The other ingredients are simply
            garlic poweder, salt, sugar, distilled vinegar, with potassium sorbate, sodium bisulfite, and xanthan gum as
            the preservatives and thickeners.

        <h2 id='scoville'>Scoville</h2>

        <p>The bright color of the sauce makes it seem that it is quite hot, but in actuality, it really isn't too
            bad. When it comes to heat, peppers and other spicy foods are measured in Scoville units. Click on the <a
                href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale'>link to learn more about the Scoville Scale</a>.
            Srirach falls into the jalapeno category when it comes to heat, about 2,500-8,000 SHUs, which is definite
            more than, say, a bell pepper or those peperoncinis you sometimes get with pizzas, but not nearly as hot as
            serrano or habeneros.

        <h2 id='uses'>Uses</h2>
        <p>There is no lack of use for this sauce. Use to it top your burger. Place a few drops on your eggs, or in any
            soups. Have it top rice or drizzle it on your noodles. Sriracha is a versatile topping that can make most
            foods go from good to great! </p>
